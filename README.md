# Stockfighter Clojure Edition

Learning Clojure. It's my first Lisp so I'm sure it'll be cringeworthy for old clojure hands but it's pretty fun and I've been meaning to try [Stockfighter](https://starfighter.readme.io/v1.0/docs) for a while.


It's my first clojure project and I'm pretty much living in `lein repl`, so at any given point this project probably will not compile since I'm focusing on poking around there instead.

### TODO

 * Make order, execution, and quote records with validation
 * Make a clean way to just set up monitoring on a given stock (instead of having to set up execution and quote and order monitoring seperately)
