# Stockfighter Clojure Edition

Learning Clojure. It's my first Lisp so I'm sure it'll be cringeworthy for old clojure hands but it's pretty fun and I've been meaning to try [Stockfighter](https://starfighter.readme.io/v1.0/docs) for a while.


It's my first clojure project and I'm pretty much living in `lein repl`, so at any given point this project probably will not compile since I'm focusing on poking around there instead.
